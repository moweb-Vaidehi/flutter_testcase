**Defination:**
Flutter Test Case is a technique used to verify the functionality and behavior of Flutter application by executing tests. It includes testing of the application's UI components, logic, and overall functionality.

**Use of it:**
Flutter Test Cases help in detecting defects and issues early in the development lifecycle, which can save time and money. It ensures that the application is working as expected and meets the user's requirements. It also helps in reducing the manual effort required to test the application.

**Types of Testing in Flutter:**

1) Unit Testing
2) Widget Testing 
3) Integration Testing

**What it includes for this context:**
For this project related to Flutter Test Case, I created Login UI and Home Screen, it includes the following:

- Testing the UI components of Login Screen using Widget Test Case to ensure the components such as text fields, buttons, etc., are working as expected.
- Mocking the data using Mocktail plugin to ensure that the tests are not dependent on external data sources.
- Integration Test Cases(Automation Testing) to test the navigation from Login Screen to Home Screen and e2e testing.

**To Run Integration Test use following command(You can run from UI also):**
 flutter test integration_test
